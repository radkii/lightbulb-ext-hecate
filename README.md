# lightbulb-ext-hecate
File driven wrappers around lightbulb extensions and plugins.

## Installation
Hecate can be installed through pip:
```bash
pip install lightbulb-ext-hecate
```

## First Steps
A template for a basic hecate extension can be generated by running
```bash
python -m lightbulb.ext.hecate --template REL_PATH_TO_EXTENSION
```
granted a .py file already exists in the desired directory.

The following directory structure
```bash
.
└── extension.py
```
will become
```bash
.
├── slash-commands
│   └── pong.py
├── __modify__.py
└── extension.py
```
