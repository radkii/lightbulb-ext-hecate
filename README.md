# Hecate
File driven wrappers around lightbulb extensions and plugins.

## Installation
Hecate can be installed through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
```bash
pip install lightbulb-ext-hecate
```

## First Steps
A pong slash command template for a basic hecate extension can be generated by running
```bash
python -m lightbulb.ext.hecate --template REL_PATH_TO_PY
```
granted a .py extension file already exists in the desired directory.

The following directory structure
```bash
.
└── extension.py
```
will become
```bash
.
├── events
│   ├── GuildMessageCreateEvent.py
│   ├── _GuildMessageDeleteEvent.py
├── slash-commands
│   ├── ping.py
│   └── pong_count.py
├── __modify__.py
└── extension.py
```
where `REL_PATH_TO_PY` is `extension.py`

## Usage

The structure of a hecate extension file is as follows:
```python
# File: extension.py

# Import the Plugin class
from lightbulb.ext.hecate import Plugin

# Create a Plugin instance (__file__ is necessary to fetch the commands and events in other files)
plugin = Plugin('EXTENSION', __file__)

# Plain lightbulb extension load method
def load(bot):
    bot.add_plugin(plugin)
```

### Adding commands

A command associated with a hecate extension can be added by creating a python file - `COMMAND_TYPE/COMMAND_NAME` - in the extension directory.
`COMMAND_TYPE` should be one of:
- `prefix-commands`
- `message-commands`
- `user-commands`
- `slash-commands`
(matching the `lightbulb.commands.Command` subclass of the same name).
Hecate, by default, will interpret the file name `COMMAND_NAME` as the name of the command (without the extension :P). However, a different name can be set in the contents of the file.

All commands must declare a `command` async method:
```python
async def command(ctx: lightbulb.Context):
    pass
```

Command attributes like `description`, `options` and `name` can be set by simply declaring the appropriate variables:
```python
description : str = "Replies with 'Pong!'"
options : list[hecate.Option] = [Option('amount', "Number of times to ping", int)]
name : str = 'ping'
```

Alternatively, the `hecate.Params` object can be used. A hecate extension will prioritize any attributes set in the params object.
```python
params = hecate.Params(
    description="Replies with 'Pong!'",
    options=[Option('amount', "Number of times to ping", int)],
    name='ping'
)
```

### Adding events

An event associated with a hecate extension can be added by creating a python file - `events/HIKARI_EVENT` - in the extension directory.
`HIKARI_EVENT` should be a valid hikari event.

All events must declare an `event` async method:
```python
async def event(e: hikari.Event):
    pass
```

### Shared attributes

It may be necessary for commands to share attributes, such as in the template. The `hecate.Properties` object can be used to achieve this. A command/event can request to access a shared attribute, and all the requests will be resolved when the hecate extension loads.
The requests are made by means of keyword arguments in the constructor:
```python
# properties.foo and properties.bar will be available in the command/event method
properties = hecate.Properties(foo=0, bar="")
```

A command/event will not have access to attributes that it didn't specify in the constructor, even if they were requested somewhere else. Requests should have as value `None`, a falsy value or all hold the same truthy value. The last truthy value found will be the default value for the given attribute, upon resolving.
```python
# File: command1.py
properties = Properties(foo=0)
# File command2.py
properties = Properties(foo=5)
# ...
# OK (properties.foo == 5 for both)

# File: command1.py
properties = Properties(foo=0)
# File command2.py
properties = Properties(foo=0)
# ...
# OK (properties.foo == 0 for both)

# File: command1.py
properties = Properties(foo=3)
# File command2.py
properties = Properties(foo=5)
# ...
# ERROR
```

The optional argument `default_properties` on the `hecate.Plugin` object will, if defined, override all previous logic and set the default value of the given attributes.
```python
plugin = Plugin('EXTENSION', __file__, default_properties={'foo': 5})
```

### Modifiers

Modifiers can be useful to add the same piece of functionality to all commands at once, for example, to debug commands or handle errors.
They are declared as async methods in the python file `__modify__.py` in the extension directory.

Implemented modifiers:
- `on_event_error(e_ctx: hecate.EventContext, e: hikari.Event)` - called when an event throws an error
- `on_command_error(com_ctx: hecate.CommandContext, lightbulb.ctx: Context)` - called when a command throws an error
- `on_command_enter(com_ctx: CommandContext, ctx: Context)` - called before a command
- `on_command_exit(com_ctx: CommandContext, ctx: Context)` - called after a command

They can also be declared on the `hecate.Plugin` object, which will override the `__modify__.py` declaration
```python
plugin = Plugin('EXTENSION', __file__, on_event_error=func1, on_command_error=func2, ...)
```

### Other features

Prefixing the file name of a command or event with `_` will disable it, making the hecate extension ignore the file completely.
